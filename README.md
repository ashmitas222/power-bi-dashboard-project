Turnover Rate = (Number of employees who left / Total number of employees) * 100
Time-to-Fill = Average time to fill vacancies in days
Training Completion Rate = (Number of employees who completed training / Total number of employees enrolled in training) * 100
Engagement Score = Average score from employee engagement surveys
